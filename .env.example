# AI Trading System - Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and add your API keys

# ===== GROQ API (REQUIRED for fast AI responses) =====
# Get your free API key from: https://console.groq.com/
# Groq provides the fastest LLM inference (free tier available)
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_groq_api_key_here

# ===== OPENAI API (OPTIONAL fallback) =====
# Only needed if you want to use OpenAI instead of Groq
# Get your key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_api_key_here

# ===== ANTHROPIC API (OPTIONAL alternative) =====
# Only needed if you want to use Claude instead of Groq/OpenAI
# Get your key from: https://console.anthropic.com/
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here

# ===== NOTES =====
# - GROQ_API_KEY is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (free, fast, works great)
# - Without any API key, the system will use mock LLM responses
# - API keys are kept secure and never shared
